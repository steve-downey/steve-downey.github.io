<html><body><p>I just finished up Agyar, by Steven Brust. This was a nice piece of
<br>modern day Gothic horror. Our hero, Jack Agyar, is gradually revealed
<br>as the monster. Through a combination of elision and selective
<br>narration, the details are only revealed slowly through the
<br>story. Within the story, the narrative is being written by Jack on a
<br>typewriter he finds in the house where is residing. The device allows
<br>for a significant amount of self-reflection and musing on the nature
<br>of writing and remembering, which none-the-less does not get in the
<br>way of the plot.
<br><br><br>Brust's solid descriptions of late-winter nights in a University town in
<br>Ohio are magnificent, and help ground the wild fantasy of conversing
<br>with the century-old ghost of a ex-slave, who haunts the house where
<br>Agyar has taken up residence. The ghost, Jim, acts as a foil and
<br>confidant for Jack, allowing us to discover Jacks background through
<br>the narrative, rather than having the information dumped on us.
<br><br>Brust follows all of the coventions of a modern Vampire story, but
<br>never bothers to explain them, trusting the reader to be aware of them
<br>and identify them from being shown their effects. He starts by never
<br>permitting Agyar to enter a building except when invited. He slowly
<br>introduces other aspects of Vampire lore, while never using the word
<br>at all.
<br><br>I'm glad this book is back in print. I discovered Brust only a few
<br>years ago, and have only a few books left to discover in his back
<br>catalog. I remember passing "Brokedown Palace" and "Jhereg" by in the
<br>mid-80's. That was a mistake then, and one I'm gladly correcting now.
