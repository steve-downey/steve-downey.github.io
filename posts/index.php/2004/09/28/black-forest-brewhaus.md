<html><body><p>Last Monday of the month is usually Beer Club night at the <a href="http://www.blackforestbrewhaus.com/">Black Forest</a>, but due to scheduling conflicts, the Brewmaster asked to reschedule. <span title="Link" onmousedown="CheckFormatting(event);FormatbarButton('richeditorframe', this, 8);ButtonMouseDown(this);"></span>
<br><br>We ignored him.
<br><br>Particularly since a good friend is in town for the week before going to Kuwait, on the way to Iraq.
<br><br>In any case, this year's Octoberfest is outstanding. Malty and rich, without being cloyingly sweet. A little heavy at 6.7% ABV. The Hefeweizen is a better session beer.
