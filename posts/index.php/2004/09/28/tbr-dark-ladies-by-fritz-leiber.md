<html><body><p>This is a two in one. "Conjure Wife" and "Our Lady of Darkness".
<br><br>I know I've got Conjure Wife somewhere, in an old edition, but I don't have any chance of getting Our Lady of Darkness. I've liked pretty much everything he's written, so I picked this one up, also.
<br><br>This is pretty far away in style from Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser, but that's not a bad thing, as much as I loved those books.
