<html><body><p>This is a reissue of all of Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy novels and short stories, which have been out of print for far too long. I have at least one of them, and probably two, packed away somewhere, but I'm looking forward to reading the rest.
<br><br>Eric Flint is the editor, and, from what I've seen recently, he's going through Baen's backlist and doing something about books that aren't in print but should be.
<br><br>I'll post notes once I read the book.
