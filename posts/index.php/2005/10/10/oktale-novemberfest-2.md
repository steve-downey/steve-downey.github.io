<html><body><p>So the beer has been brewed, and, as of this morning is bubbling away happily in the primary fermenter. It's not as heavy as I had planned, coming out at 1.042 Original Gravity, partly due to brewing 5 1/2 gallons, rather than 5, and also to poor mash efficiency. I think I let the mash cool off too much during sparging, and didn't rinse the sugars out as effectively as possible. <br><br>I pitched a 1 liter starter of the White Labs Duseldorf Alt yeast, and fermentation was active several hours later, and well going by the morning. I'll move it to the basement tonight, to keep it a bit cool.</p></body></html>
