I've got a spare Dell Optiplex gx110 that I try out new Linux distros on. Now it's going to be a test bed for OpenSolaris.<br><br>First step is downloading everything. Well, almost first step. Real first step was going out and buying a new sleeve of CD-R's , because I don't know where the last one went. Then,<blockquote>Before you begin, you will need to read the <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/downloads/releasenotes-20050612.txt">Release Notes</a>. Really. The whole thing.</blockquote>
<br><br>So, I did that, too.<br><br>Now, I'm waiting for isos to come down, as well as Sun Studio 10.  Overall, looks like about an hour and a half. Then burn and start install.<br><br>I'll probably get to the actual OpenSolaris parts tomorrow.<br><br>Technorati Tag: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/OpenSolaris" rel="tag">OpenSolaris</a></body></html>
