I usually end up with a few stray bottles of a brew hanging on forever. But, since the keg is really all or nothing, I just finished it up. <br><br>The only down side is that I don't have another brewing at the moment. I'll have to get to work on that this weekend. Probably a basic Pale Ale, consisting of whatever they have on hand at my local homebrew store,  <a href="http://www.homebrewshop.com/">Karp's Homebrew Shop</a>.</body></html>
