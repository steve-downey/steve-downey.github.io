    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<br><p><span>C++ is known to be a multi-paradigmed language. This is often construed<br>to mean you can program in both a procedural and and object oriented<br>style.  This is too limiting a view. C++, particularly with modern<br>library support, is more than capable of supporting programming in<br>the functional style. Even without modern libraries like boost, or<br>std::tr1, the Standard Template Library embodies many functional<br>concepts.</span></p>
<br><p><span>It also turns out  that the template system in C++ defines a<br>metaprogramming language that is a pure, non-strict, lazy, functional<br>language. Of course, since this was not by design, it is not a<br>particularly elegant language, as anyone who has had to do template<br>metaprogramming can attest. For right now, though, I'm going to stay<br>away from metaprogramming, and look just at what can be done in the<br>language with the facilities provided. </span><br></p>
<br><h2>What is functional programming</h2>
<br><p><span>At the base, it is performing computations by the pure application of<br>functions, with no side-effects. Of course C has allowed this since<br>its inception, and it is never considered a functional language.<br>There is a lot of debate, and at least a little acrimony, in<br>determining if a language is functional. There are certainly many<br>claims of 'my language is more functional that yours.' </span><br></p>
<br><p><span>Languages that are widely regarded as pure functional languages are Haskell and<br>ML. Haskell is also getting a lot of alpha geek buzz, for a number of<br>reasons, and has finally hit the stage where people are learning it<br>in order to work on something other than a Haskell compiler. </span><br></p>
<br><p><span>The flavor of ML most commonly encountered is O'caml. The optimizing<br>compilers for the language are quite powerful, and programs often<br>compete, and beat, equivalent C programs in efficiency and<br>performance. </span><br></p>
<br><p><span>The LISP family has deep functional roots, with Scheme being the version<br>that focuses the most on functional purity, as well as simplicity and<br>ease of teaching. Common Lisp has a much broader range of libraries<br>and facilties defined for it and standardised for it. </span><br></p>
<br><p><br><span>JavaScript, Ruby and Python also all have a strong functional component to them. </span><br></p>
<br><p><span>Examining these languages leads to the observation that the real keys seem to<br>be</span><br></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span> Functions as first class objects </span><br>
</li>
<li><span> Referential transparency of expressions</span></li>
<li><span> Partial application, a.k.a currying.</span></li>
<li><span> Unnamed functions, a.k.a lambda expressions</span></li>
</ol>
<br><p><span>All of these features have been implemented in C++, in the language<br>itself, in the Standard Library, in TR1, in Boost, or in custom<br>libraries such as FC++. This article will examine these in more<br>depth, and show how they can be profitably incorporated into your<br>existing practice.</span></p>
<br><p><span>First let's examine what the four cornerstones of functional programming<br>really mean.</span></p>
<br><p><span>Functions as first class objects means that functions can be used in the same<br>way as all other entities in the language. In particular, that they<br>can be passed as values to functions, returned as values from<br>functions, and new ones can be created at runtime. In C, function<br>pointers can be passed and returned as values, but creating new<br>functions is not (portably) possible. In C++, however, we can create<br>objects that overload operator(), that satisfy all of the desired<br>properties. Function pointers can also be treated much more generally<br>with std::tr1::function objects. </span><br></p>
<br><p><span>Referential transparency of expressions means that an expression, or any of its<br>sub-expressions can be replaced by the value of that expression or<br>sub-expression without changing the behavior of the program as a<br>whole. A computation will always return the same result, and will<br>only depend on the value of its arguments. This implies that there<br>are no side-effects to evaluating an expression. No globals that can<br>be changed, producing non-local changes elsewhere. This property<br>gives the programmer, and the compiler and runtime, strong<br>capabilities to reason about the program, optimize it, and<br>demonstrate its correctness.</span></p>
<br><p><span>Partial application is one of the most unusual, and most powerful, features<br>of functional programming. This is also known as currying, after<br>Haskell Curry, a mathematician in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> Century who<br>did some of the fundamental work in combinatory logic and the lambda<br>calculus. Currying takes a function of N parameters and turns it into<br>a function of N-1 parameters by fixing the value of one of the<br>formers arguments. Or, another way of looking at it, is to say that a<br>function that takes N arguments is equivalent to a chain of N<br>functions, each taking 1 argument and returning a function that<br>consumes the next argument. Haskell Curry invented it as a way of<br>talking about multi-variate functions in a theory of functions of one<br>variable. Well, Shoenfinkel invented it first, but shoenfinkling<br>never really caught on.</span></p>
<br><p><span>Unnamed functions don't sound very useful. However, combined with<br>higher-order functions, that is functions that take and return<br>functions as parameters, they become very powerful, and quite useful.<br>If you've ever wanted to supply a simple function inline in a one of<br>the STL algorithms, but were frustrated with the syntax:</span></p>
<br><p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>    <span>compose2(</span></p>
<span>        plus<int>(),<br></int></span><span>        compose2(</span><span>multiplies<int>(),<br></int></span><div>
<span>            bind2nd(plus<int>(),</int></span><span>0.0),</span>
</div>            bind2nd(plus<int>(),<span>0.0)),</span><span><br>       bind2nd(plus<int>(),1))</int></span><br></int>
</blockquote>
<br>you've wanted a better way of writing lambda expressions. Lambda calculus is one of the fundamental theories of computation, and while I'm temptedto start a lengthy exposition, I think a few of quick examples will<span>give you the flavor.</span><br><p><span>(Haskell)<br></span></p>
<blockquote><p>\x -&gt; x*x + x + 1</p></blockquote>
<br><p><span>(Lisp)<br><blockquote>(lambda (k) (+(+(* k k) k) 1) )</blockquote></span></p>
<br><p><span>(Boost.Lambda (c++))</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<blockquote><p>  _1 * _1 + _1 + 1</p></blockquote>
<br><p>The key is that you can provide a definition of a function and then bind<br>it to a variable, rather than a fixed name. Ideally with nearly the<br>same syntax as you would use if you did name the function. Functional<br>languages are often defined in terms of lambda expressions and the<br>lambda calculus, with syntactic sugar sprinkled on top to make it<br>more palatable. I'm using syntactic sugar in the techincal sense of a<br>well defined transformation from one syntactic form to a more<br>primitive syntactic form. The thing to keep in mind is that too much<br>syntactic sugar causes truth decay.</p>
<br><p><br><br></p>
<br><h2>Objects vs Values</h2>
<br><p>“<span>Just like an int” has been a mainstay of C++ programming since the very<br>beginning. The phrase indicates that you can create a new type with<br>all of the capabilities of a built-in type. What many programmers<br>don't realize is that the behavior of ints is a polar opposite of the<br>behavior expected of objects. That is because ints are quintessential<br>value types. And whereas an object is an entity with state and<br>identity, values have neither. This 7 here is indistinguishable from<br>that 7 over there. And 7 never changes (unless you;re using an old<br>version of FORTRAN) into 8. You evaluate an expression such as 7+1,<br>and produce an 8, but the original 7 is unaffected. Objects are<br>different. This object is always distinct from that object, even if<br>they have the same state. You can change Bob, and everyone who has a<br>reference to Bob sees the change also. Unfortunately, the mechanism<br>by which you produce new value types in C++ is exactly the same as<br>how you produce new object types. You declare a new class.</span></p>
<br><p><span>What you permit and accept by default with that class determines whether<br>instances of the class behave like values or like objects. The key<br>pieces of machinery in the language are familiar to all C++<br>programmers: default construction, copy construction, copy assignment<br>and destruction. The compiler will provide ones that by default act<br>(mostly) like a value. Mostly, because of the shallow vs deep issue,<br>and the fact that pointers are values, even if what they point to<br>isn't. So what all the compiler instantiated methods do is treat each<br>member of the class as  a value, and then create, copy, assign or<br>destroy it, in the order they are declared. Unfortunately, for the<br>programmer concerned with efficiency, and almost all C++ programmers<br>are, these copies are, or can be very expensive.</span></p>
<br><p><span>Objects, on the other hand, typically either do not accept the default<br>implementations, or they avoid invoking them. Usually when you say<br>object2 = object1, you want them to continue to refer to the same<br>entity. In fact, assignment is fraught with danger, with potential<br>slicing when assigning a derived to a base. Programmers will either<br>use a Handle/Body or pimpl_ pattern to separate the implementation<br>side of the class from the reference side of it, or use a smart<br>pointer such as std::tr1::shared_ptr. In the evil past, some<br>programmers would attempt to use raw pointers, and manage the<br>allocated resources by hand. In practice, it turns out that no one is<br>smart enough to do so successfully in any program of interesting<br>size. Or at the very least, if the original programmer is that smart,<br>the next person to attempt to enhance the system, or fix a bug, is<br>not that smart.</span></p>
<br><p><span>Lazy functional programming languages, such as Haskell, avoid the price of<br>copying values by only evaluating an expression when it is needed.<br>This is guaranteed to be correct because of referential transparency.<br>Although it can lead to puzzling runtime behavior. I've coded some<br>benchmarks which seem to take practically no time, because it turns<br>out that the calculation is never fully evaluated. This takes not<br>paying for what you don't use to the n-th degree. This call-by-need<br>behavior is why they are characterized as lazy. </span><br></p>
<br><p><span>Getting this behavior in C++ is tricky, but far from unheard of. One<br>technique, used in numerical libraries such as Blitz++, and pioneered<br>by Todd Veldhuizen, is known as expression templates.</span></p>
<br><p><span>The problem expression templates were introduced to solve is the creation<br>of unneeded temporaries. Take for example the code</span></p>
<br><p><span> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Array A,B,C,D;</p>
<br><p> //<br>... stuff<br></p>
<br><p> D = A * B + C</p>
<br><p></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Where each of A, B, C and D are two-d arrays, with the usual definitions<br>for multiplication and addition. The straightforward implementation<br>of operators *() and +() lead to the creation and destruction of<br>temporaries, with associated memory allocation and destruction. e.g.</span></p>
<br><p><br><br></p>
<br><p><span><span>Array operator *(const Array&amp; lhs, const Array&amp; rhs);</span></span></p>
<br><p><span>has to create and return a new array, which might be quite large, only to<br>have it used temporarily in Array operator +(const Array&amp;, const<br>Array&amp;) and then discarded. And even once the expression on the<br>right hand side of the assignment statement is evaluated, it has to<br>be passed into the copy assignment operator and very likely discarded<br>afterwards. (note that this is not an initialization, so that<br>permitted optimization does not apply).</span></p>
<br><p><span>Template expressions change the operators to return something else, an<br>expression that encapsulates the arguments, and evaluates them only<br>when necessary. </span><br></p>
<br><p><span><span> ArrayExpression operator +(const Array&amp;, const Array&amp;amp;);</span></span></p>
<br><p><span>Where ArrayExpression looks something like</span></p>
<br><p><span><span>class<br>ArrayExpression {</span></span></p>
<br><p><span><span>const Array&amp; lhs;</span></span></p>
<br><p><span><span>const Array&amp; rhs;</span></span></p>
<br><p><span><span>//....<br>more stuff</span></span></p>
<br><p><span><span>double operator(int,int); //compute the value at the point</span></span></p>
<br><p><span><span>}</span></span></p>
<br><p><span>Now, for lazy languages, like Haskell, this can be built into the language<br>itself, and in this case the concept is called a 'thunk'. Because by<br>the time you need to think about it, the thought has already been<br>thunk. Yes, it's a really awful joke. You have to remember, we work<br>in an industry where an extremely popular language is named after an<br>obscure, although influential, comedy troupe. Other industries do not<br>consider understanding why Norwegian Blue Parrots are funny a job<br>qualification. Nor do most of our managers, unless they came up<br>through the ranks themselves. </span><br></p>
<br><p><span>Referential transparency makes thunks extremely powerful because not only can<br>they be passed around instead of fully evaluated values, once they<br>are fully evaluated, the system can remember that value and use it<br>from then on. This is very much like common sub-expression<br>elimination, only it is a runtime feature, as well as a compile time<br>optimization.</span></p>
